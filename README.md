# Texts
* Electronic structure: Basic Theory and Practical Methods, Richard Martin 

**Pros:** Extremely comprehensive description of methods and approximations in electronic structure. Deep, careful discussion of quantities of interest, and how they are calculated, and caveats of different methods of calculation. Quick but reasonable treatment of subtleties (noninteracting V-representability, etc) in density functional theory.

**Cons:** A bit overwhelming for someone completely new to the field of electronic structure. Personally felt more as a very good reference than the most approachable textbook out there. Notation-heavy, and definitely becomes more useful as one gets more acquainted with the field.
* Electronic Structure: Calculations for Solids and Molecules: Theory and Computational Methods, Jorge Kohanoff
* Fundamentals of Condensed Matter Physics, Marvin L. Cohen and Steven G. Louie

**Pros:** _Very_ good 'advanced' introduction to condensed matter physics. Illuminating, simple schematic diagrams showing electron correlation, thorough, careful discussion of the physical concepts behind the mathematical formulae, and always great discussion on the limiting cases of complex physical systems that cannot be analytically solved. Extremely comprehensive section(s) on dielectric and in general response functions, great treatment of phonons and their relation to dielectric properties.

**Cons:** Not an 'intro' intro. A good read of Simon's Solid State Basics, or Ashcroft/Mermin will help before seeing things here.
* The Theory of Quantum Liquids, David Pines and Philippe Nozieres
* Materials Modelling using Density Functional Theory: Properties and Predictions, Feliciano Giustino
* Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid: Gabriele F. Giuliani and Giovanni Vignale
